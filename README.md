# Welcome to the ORV Wiki/Guide/Handbook/Thing

This is a massive project that I have decided to work on which will basically be an everything ORV (Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint) website. 

(This is a passion project which will NEVER be monetized for personal gain, however you will need to show proof of purchase of ORV novel and/or manwha to access the Read page to avoid legal complications. There is a donation page planned so that contributors, fan contest winners, etc. can get a chance to access the Read page based on their efforts)

I know almost nothing on how to code so any help will be much appreciated. I chose to build this on react as it looked beautiful and my light research concluded that to have this be highly interactive, reactjs was my best option.

(Huge shoutout to @EGATORTUTORIALS for posting his crystal clear tutorials that have allowed me to get started on this HUGE project)

## "Roadmap"
*not based on priority or chornoligical order, just all the plans I have for this project. Any recommendations will be helpful*

***WIP!!!***

 - A unique loading animation, most likely based on the ORV novel logo. 

 ![ORV logo for loading animation](https://github.com/StudentShake/orv-wiki/blob/master/src/assets/logo.jpg?raw=true)

### Homepage
(*I'm speaking in desktop screen terms but I will also fix this for mobile and other stuff*)

- Top left corner will have a text animation that read "Welcome to ORV!" that transforms to other languages
- A kind of blurb text introducing ORV on the left side
- Top right corner will have the navbar with icons that reveal text when hovered on
- Right side will have some sort of planet based art that changes depending on how far you are in the story.

Concept Art:
    Desktop:

    Mobile:

- Scrolling down will show 
    - previews of the reading view, 
    - a few snippets of the guide, 
    - a showcase of the search page,
    - a small walkthrough through the contribution page and how to use it, 
    - a gallery view of the community page with different tabs for fan art, fics, events, forums, blogs, etc. 
    - a contact menu
    - and finally a roadmap voting thing where you can see what I am currently working on and vote for what feature should come out next and/or recommend new features I should implement

### Read Page

If I recall correctly, the first chapter or the first few chapter of both the novel and manwha are "free" and therefore you can access them in Guest Mode / F2P mode here as well

You will first be faces with 2 options, the novel or the manwha. Again, the first or the first few chapters will be free.

If you want to read the novel, you should be able to read both the webnovel and the ebook, and you can see a short summary of the differences in content in two columns, like how it looks when you compare two subscription plans. Ebook option will come with the edition of the side stories.

Besides the difference in actual content, the reading mode will work the same.

**Reading Mode** (*Text*):

- ALL OPTIONS CAN BE TOGGLED ON/OFF

- Convert all text to Bionic text (doubles reading speed and helps with ADHD)

- Smart Linking (to the guide)
    - Like Wikipedia links (so in-line hyperlinks) but intelligent and controllable (*inspired from obsidian.md*)
    - For example, links will naturally appear when there have been changes made to the guide. Yes, the guide will change its content depending on what chapter you are on. 
    - Instead of opening a whole new webpage and taking you out of the reading page, you can just hover over the smart links and a small window popup summarizing the changes/additions will be there
    - The "spawn rate" of the smart links can be customizable, ranging from no smart links, to every single other concept or word being mentioned having a smart link.
    - Spawn rate can change also depending on your behaviour interacting with the settings and your daily reading amount (so say you haven't read orv for the past month, the spawn rate of the smart links will increase since you might've forgotten stuff)
    - Smart link shenanigans will also change depending on if it's your second or third read.

- Marginal Notes
    - Notes on the margin that highlight certain important events, provide context and background for scenarios, e.g. explaining dokkaebis in korean culture, contexualizing murim, etc.
    - Definition of some words
    - Explaining concepts like for example film theory
    - Referencing explanations done in previous chapters
    - Highlighting a difference between the ebook and the webnovel
    - Place to keep YOUR comments and bookmarks
    - Focus on important/iconic quotes

- Chapter Summary Infoboxes / Highlights
    - Basically a summary of all the plot points and changes in the chapter
    - For Example: 
        - ! New Content in Character Guide: Kim Dokja, Yoo Jonghyuk, Nirvana Moebius's Status has been updated.
        - ! New Scenario Cleared, New Location unlocked "Underworld", check World Guide.
    - Can also highlight important reveals that are indirectly said and might confuse readers.

- Rereading Hints
    - Rereading is a big part of ORV and its so detailed that underlining these small nuanced hints and breadcrumbs that foreshadow and reference the events that will happen later on help rereaders appreciate the story even more

- Literary Analysis mode:
    - ...

-  Music
    - I suck with music but once the money starts coming in istg im building a genshin style symphony for this novel like imaging reading a huge fight war scene with battle sounds and a whole ass opera like damn its gonna be amazing.
