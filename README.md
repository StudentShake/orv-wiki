# Welcome to the ORV Wiki/Guide/Handbook/Thing

This is a massive project that I have decided to work on which will basically be an everything ORV (Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint) website. 
I know almost nothing on how to code so any help will be much appreciated. I chose to build this on react as it looked beautiful and my light research concluded that to have this be highly interactive, reactjs was my best option.

(Huge shoutout to @EGATORTUTORIALS for posting his crystal clear tutorials that have allowed me to get started on this HUGE project)

## "Roadmap"
*not based on priority or chornoligical order, just all the plans I have for this project. Any recommendations will be helpful*

 - A unique loading animation, most likely based on the ORV novel logo.

### Homepage
(*I'm speaking in desktop screen terms but I will also fix this for mobile and other stuff*)

- Top left corner will have a text animation that read "Welcome to ORV!" that transforms to other languages
- A kind of blurb text introducing ORV on the bottom left
